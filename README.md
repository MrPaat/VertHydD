# VertHydD

## Overview
A python script for the calculation of vertical hydraulic diffusivity using the analytical solution from Dong et al., 2012. This code is used to calculate vertical hydraulic diffusivity using hydraulic pressure data measured in peat. The program uses reference data, measured at a certain depth in a peatland to calculate a hydraulic pressure response function at another depth, depending on the vertical hydraulic diffusivity of the material. 

## How to Use
The input data must be in .xlsx format. 
The structure of the datatable can be seen in the template_file. 
The code and input files with hydraulic pressure data must be in the same folder.

Use template_file and template_file_2 to see example results of the calculations.
