# VertHydD
A program for the calculation of vertical hydraulic diffusivity.

Used to calculate vertical hydraulic diffusivity using hydraulic pressure data measured in peat. The program uses reference data, measured at a certain depth in a peatland to calculate a hydraulic pressure response function at another depth, depending on the vertical hydraulic diffusivity of the material. 

NB! The input data must be in .xlsx format. The structure of the datatable can be seen in the template_file. The code and input files must be in the same folder.

Use template_file and template_file_2 to see example results of the calculations.
